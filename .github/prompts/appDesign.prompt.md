# Product Design Prompt — Introvert-First Social App

## Liquid Glass • Calm • Private • Emotion-Aware • Edge-to-Edge

Design a mobile social platform for **introverts and emotionally-aware users**.
The experience must feel **safe, quiet, private, fluid, and non-overwhelming**.

This is NOT a loud social feed app.

It should feel like:

- a personal journal first
- social second
- conversations third

Visual tone: calm, breathable, soft depth, glass materials, gentle motion.

# Core Experience Principles

### 1. Emotional Safety First

- No noisy UI
- No bright or aggressive colors
- Avoid clutter or heavy feed density
- Prioritize whitespace
- Slow, smooth animations only
- Reduce cognitive load

### 2. Liquid Glass Material System

Use frosted translucent surfaces:

- background blur 20–30
- rgba white 20–30% fill
- 1px light borders
- soft elevation shadows
- rounded corners 20–28
- floating layers

UI should look like **soft glass floating over content**.

---

# Layout System

### Edge-to-Edge Immersion

- No rigid title bars
- No heavy headers
- Content flows from top
- Floating controls only
- Use swipe gestures + contextual actions

Navigation chrome must be translucent blur overlays.

---

# Global Interaction Rules

### Fluid Motion

- spring animations
- subtle scale on press (0.96–0.98)
- fade + slide transitions
- bottom sheets rise like liquid
- no abrupt changes

### Keyboard Safety (mandatory)

When typing:

- input NEVER hidden behind keyboard
- composer auto-lifts above keyboard
- screen scrolls or shifts naturally
- minimum 16–24px breathing space
- avoid fixed-position collisions

# App Architecture & Workflows

Design around 5 primary constructs:

---

## 1. Journal + Mood Tracking (Primary Home)

---

This is the emotional core of the app.

Features:

- daily journaling (text, voice, photo optional)
- mood selector (emoji / color scale / energy slider)
- streak tracking
- calendar heatmap of moods
- quick-add journal from ANY screen

Design:

- calming layout
- distraction-free writing
- floating compose sheet
- soft background blur
- minimal controls

Behavior:

- “Quick Journal” button globally accessible
- opens bottom sheet above keyboard
- one tap → start writing

Visual:

- calendar with colored mood dots
- streak indicators
- gentle pastel palette

Outcome:
Feels like a personal diary, not social media.

---

---

## 2. Wall (Thought Sharing Feed)

---

A soft, low-pressure sharing space.

Content:

- text posts
- photos
- short videos
- thoughts

Interactions:

- react
- comment
- save
- soft engagement only (no loud metrics)

Rules:

- avoid follower counts or popularity pressure
- no aggressive notifications
- small reaction chips only

Design:

- glass cards
- large spacing
- slow scroll
- blurred floating tab bar

Tone:
Calm community, not dopamine feed.

---

---

## 3. Emotion-Based Discovery

---

Connection suggestions should be emotion-aware.

Matching logic:

- last journal mood
- 7-day average mood
- emotional compatibility
- shared interests

Design:

- show people as soft profile cards
- no swipe-gaming mechanics
- gentle suggestions
- “Connect mindfully” language

Interactions:

- connect
- message
- ignore quietly

Feel:
Safe introductions, not dating app pressure.

---

---

## 4. Chat (1:1 + Groups)

---

Private, comforting communication.

Features:

- 1:1 chat
- small groups
- media sharing
- voice notes optional

Design:

- translucent chat bubbles
- soft colors
- blurred background
- floating composer above keyboard
- rounded message bubbles

Behavior:

- composer sticks above keyboard
- smooth scroll
- no heavy separators

Mood:
Feels intimate and calm.

---

---

## 5. Anonymous Identity System (Critical)

---

Default identity = anonymous.

Rules:

- system-generated alias (e.g., “QuietRiver”, “SoftCloud”)
- avatar abstract, not face-based
- real name hidden by default
- toggle to reveal identity optionally

Design:

- anonymity toggle in profile
- clear privacy indicators
- no pressure to reveal self

Principle:
Users must feel psychologically safe.

---

# Global Components to Design

Create reusable components:

- Glass cards
- Floating tab bar
- Bottom sheets
- Journal composer
- Chat composer (keyboard aware)
- Reaction chips
- Anonymous avatar system
- Mood picker
- Calendar streak view
- Toasts/snackbars (glass)
- Floating action button (Quick Journal)

---

# Performance Constraints

- limit blur layers
- avoid stacked effects
- 60fps interactions
- optimize lists

---

# Emotional Outcome

Users should feel:

- calm
- understood
- safe
- unjudged
- private
- reflective

The app should feel like:
“a quiet room to think, then connect.”

---

# Deliverables Required

- design system tokens
- glass material spec
- component library
- light/dark themes
- full flows:
  - journal entry
  - wall post
  - discovery
  - chat typing state
  - anonymity toggle

- motion specs

End goal:
A fluid, emotion-first social platform where content floats like glass layers and users always feel safe — especially while writing or sharing.
